# WeatherProject
This particular project tells you the current temp and climate description on your webpage.
I have used openweatherMap API (https://openweathermap.org/api) to get the current temperature and climate description of a particular place.
I have used Nodejs html javascript and basic packages.
The dependenies of the node modules are in the package.json file.

This particular project helps you how to use APIs.
